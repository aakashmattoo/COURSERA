                To me respect means to be kind to everyone and treat others the way you want to be treated.

Respect can be shown in many ways. In the video the man shows respect by watering other people’s plants, feeding a homeless dog, bringing bananas to an older lady, helping someone push a cart over the curb and giving a lady and her daughter 100 dollars everyday. In the beginning the man gets nothing in return, with people giving him nasty looks and unwanted shakes of the head. However by the end of the video people grow to respect him too, and he is shown that what he does matters to people.

I can show respect in many places. Some ways to show respect at school can be, holding a door for someone, helping someone carry their things, or help to clean/pick up with someone. Some ways to show respect out of school, around the community and at home can be picking up after yourself and others, helping with chores, carrying someone’s groceries to there car and even picking up litter.<br>

It’s possible that showing respect may be hard in some situations. This could be because you maybe don’t have respect for yourself or your just really frustrated with the situation. You may not have respect for yourself if you believe what others are saying and doing and put no faith in yourself. for example the man in the video didn’t let others put him down, when no one believed in him or thought he was doing the right thing he knew he was and kept going with it. Lots of people don’t believe in themselves and let others control their lives and get to them, forcing them to give up on what they think is right.
Self-Respect refers to loving oneself and behaving with honour and dignity. It reflects Respect for oneself. An individual who has Self-Respect would treat himself with honour. Furthermore, lacking Self-Respect is a matter of disgrace. An individual who does not respect himself, should certainly not expect Respect from others. This is because nobody likes to treat such an individual with Respect.

Self-Respect is the foundation of a healthy relationship. In relationships, it is important to respect your partner. Similarly, it is equally important to Respect yourself. A Self-Respecting person accepts himself with his flaws. This changes the way how others perceive the individual. An individual, who honours himself, would prevent others from disrespecting him. This certainly increases the value of the individual in the eyes of their partner.<br>

Lacking Self-Respect brings negative consequences. An individual who lacks Self-Respect is treated like a doormat by others. Furthermore, such an individual may engage in bad habits. Also, there is a serious lack of self-confidence in such a person. Such a person is likely to suffer verbal or mental abuse. The lifestyle of such an individual also becomes sloppy and untidy.

Self-Respect is a reflection of toughness and confidence. Self-Respect makes a person accept more responsibility. Furthermore, the character of such a person would be strong. Also, such a person always stands for his rights, values, and opinions.

Self-Respect improves the morality of the individual. Such an individual has a good ethical nature. Hence, Self-Respect makes you a better person.

Self-Respect eliminates the need to make comparisons. This means that individuals don’t need to make comparisons with others. Some people certainly compare themselves with others on various attributes. Most noteworthy, they do this to seek validation of others. Gaining Self-Respect ends all that.

Respect of Others
Everyone must Respect fellow human beings. This is an essential requirement of living in a society. We certainly owe a basic level of Respect to others. Furthermore, appropriate Respect must be shown to people who impact our lives. This includes our parents, relatives, teachers, friends, fellow workers, authority figures, etc.<br>

One of the best ways of showing respect to others is listening. Listening to another person’s point of view is an excellent way of Respect. Most noteworthy, we must allow a person to express his views even if we disagree with them.

Another important aspect of respecting others is religious/political views. Religious and cultural beliefs of others should be given a lot of consideration. Respecting other people’s Religions is certainly a sign of showing mature Respect.

Everyone must Respect those who are in authority. Almost everyone deals with people in their lives that hold authority. So, a healthy amount of Respect should be given to such people. People of authority can be of various categories. These are boss, police officer, religious leader, teacher, etc.

In conclusion, Respect is a major aspect of human socialization. It is certainly a precious value that must be preserved. Respectful behaviour is vital for human survival.
